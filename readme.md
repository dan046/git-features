The popular platform for hosting and collaborating on code repositories is GitHub. Here are a few of the features I've discovered:

Repositories: GitHub lets you store and manage your code repositories. You can either create a new repository or import one from another service.

Issues: Issues are a way to track and manage bugs, feature requests, and other repository-related tasks. You can delegate tasks to team members and monitor their progress.

Pull Requests: A pull request is a method of proposing changes to a repository. You can make a pull request, then review and discuss the changes before merging them into the repository.

Branches: Branches allow you to work on multiple versions of your code at the same time. When you're finished, you can create a new branch, make changes, and merge it back into the main branch.

Collaboration: GitHub provides tools for collaborating on your code with others. You can invite collaborators to your repository, review and discuss changes, and merge them in.

P.S. While I appreciate the features offered by GitHub, I prefer to use the git command line over GitHub directly. It is more efficient and adaptable to my workflow. GitHub, on the other hand, remains a valuable tool for collaborating with others and managing code repositories.# git-features
